#+title: Automaton Edification

Homebrew machine learning and stuff.

Code is written in Julia.

** Bootstrapping the environment

To install and update all declared dependencies:

#+begin_src
julia> ]
(@v<version>) pkg> activate .
(AutomatonEdification) pkg> instantiate
(AutomatonEdification) pkg> update
#+end_src

To add additional packages as dependencies:

#+begin_src
(AutomatonEdification) pkg> add <package-name>
#+end_src

** Working in the REPL

Start the REPL by running:

#+begin_src
julia --project=@. [--threads=<num-threads>]
#+end_src

in the project directory, which automatically loads the project environment.

To load a Julia script in the REPL:

#+begin_src
julia> include("<filename.jl>")
#+end_src

** Running executable and tests

All library files are included from the main package file,
=src/AutomatonEdification.jl=. Available executables are also listed in that
file as comments.

To run an executable, load the file from the project REPL:

#+begin_src
julia> include("<path_to_executable.jl>")
#+end_src

To run tests, use the =test= command from the =pkg= tool in the project root:

#+begin_src
julia> ]
(AutomatonEdification) pkg> test
#+end_src
