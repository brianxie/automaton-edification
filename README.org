** Bootstrapping the environment

To install all declared dependencies:

#+begin_src
julia> ]
(@v<version>) pkg> activate .
(automaton-edification) pkg> instantiate
#+end_src

To add additional packages as dependencies:

#+begin_src
(automaton-edification) pkg> add <package-name>
#+end_src

** Working in the REPL

Start the REPL by running:

#+begin_src
julia --project=@.
#+end_src

in the project directory, which automatically loads the project environment.

To load a Julia script in the REPL:

#+begin_src
julia> include("<filename.jl>")
#+end_src
